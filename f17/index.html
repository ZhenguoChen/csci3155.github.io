      <div id="overview" class="collapse">
        <p>
        This course is about principles, concepts, and ideas that underly
        programming languages.  But what does this statement mean?
        </p>

        <p>
        As a student of computer science, it is completely reasonable to think
        and ask, ``Why bother?  I'm proficient and like programming in Ruby.
        Isn't that enough?  Isn't language choice just a matter of taste?  If
        not, should I be using another language?''
        </p>

        <p>
        Certainly, there are social factors and an aspect of personal
        preference that affect the programming languages that we use.  But
        there is also a body of principles and mathematical theories that
        allow us to discuss and think about languages in a rigorous manner.
        We study these underpinnings because a language affects the way one
        approaches problems working in that language and affects the way one
        implements that language.  At the end of this course, we hope that you
        will have grown in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          You will be able to learn new languages quickly and select a
          suitable one for your task.
          </li>
          <li>
          You will gain new ways of viewing computation and
          approaching algorithmic problems.
          </li>
          <li>
          You will gain new ways of viewing programs.
          </li>
          <li>
          You will gain insight into avoiding mistakes for when
          you design languages.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>
        We will <em>dissect</em> programming languages by constructing
        interpreters.  The semester project is to construct an interpreter for
        <a
         href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">JavaScript</a>
        (incrementally).  We will see that interpreters are the basis for
        realizing computation, and we will study the programming language
        theory that enable us to reason carefully about a language's design
        and implementation.  Our approach will be gradual in that we will
        initially consider a small subset of JavaScript and then slowly grow
        the aspects of the language that we consider.
        </p>

        <p>Incoming students often expect this course to be what I will call a
        trip to the Zoo of Programming Languages.  While it is certainly
        interesting to go to the zoo, we seek a more informative and
        sciencific study of the underlying principles.  A more apt analogy is
        an <b>anatomy</b> course where we will study the "guts" and
        inner-workings of programming languages.  After this course, such an
        anatomological study will enable us to compare and constrast
        programming languages in a substantive manner and address the learning
        goals outlined above.</p>

        <p>
        The course covers many aspects of using, understanding, and
        reasoning about programming languages (e.g., syntax, scoping,
        induction, data types, and typing).  We will build up a set
        of mathematical tools for careful discourse.
        A significant part is devoted to abstraction, that is, how
        languages help programming in the large (e.g.,
        subtyping polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, modules, and objects).
        </p>


        <p>
        This course prepares you for introductory courses on both programming
        language implementation
        (e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci4555.html">CSCI
        4555</a>) and programming language semantics
        (e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci5535.html">CSCI
        5535</a>).
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Prerequisites -->
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#prerequisites" href="#prerequisites"><i class="fa fa-openid" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites</button>
      <div id="prerequisites" class="collapse">

        <p>
        The prerequisites for this course are CSCI 2270 (Computer Science 2: Data Structures)
        and CSCI 2824 (Discrete Mathematics).  It is also suggested that one
        of CSCI 2400 (Computer Systems) or ECEN
        2120 (Computers as Components) be either previously taken or
        be taken in the same semester.
        </p>

        <p>If you have not already taken these courses or if you have any concerns,
        please talk with the instructor. Proficiency in programming is absolutely
        expected, though there is no specific language required. This means that you
        should be able to pick up a new programming language with relative ease. You
        will be expected to learn new programming languages with guidance but
        relatively independently in this course.  </p>

        <div id="requirements" class="collapse">

          <p>
          You will be responsible for the following:
          <ul>
            <li><b><a href="assignments.html#labs">Lab
            Assignments</a></b> (30%).  This course is a project-based course,
            so most of the understanding will come from attacking the lab
            assignments. Lab assignments will be two
            weeks in length.  Because iteration on lab assignments is
            the basis for learning in this course, we offer a generous "redo"
            policy on lab assignments (see below).  No late assignments will be accepted, but your lowest lab grade will be dropped.</li>
            <li><b>Exercises</b> (10%).  There will be in-class exercises
            associated with each unit, and moodle exercises once per week. There will be no make-ups if you miss an in-class exercise, but your lowest exercise grade will be dropped.</li>
            <li><b>Midterm Exam</b> (25%). There will be one midterm exam.</li>
            <li><b>Final Exam</b> (30%).</li>
            <li><b><a href="assignments.html#participation">Class
            Participation</a></b> (5%).  Participation includes both in-class and
            online discussion.
            <li><b>Reading</b>.  There will be required articles or book
            chapters to read.  This course will emphasize learning from
            the resources out of class and actively discussing problems
            and questions in class.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Grading</b>.
            Your overall grade will be determined using the ratio for lab
            assignments, exercises, the midterm exam, the final
            exam, and class participation shown above.  There is no
            predetermined curve (i.e., I hope everyone gets an A based on the
            level of mastery demonstrated). Cutoffs will be announced after 
            the midterm exam to give you an idea where you stand.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Regrades</b>. Any concern about an error in grading must
            be submitted within <b>one week</b> of when it is
            returned. Any coursework submitted for reconsideration may be
            regraded in its entirety, which could result in a lower score if
            warranted.  To request a regrade, please go to the instructor's
            office hours with your coursework and an explanation of what you
            believe the grading error to be.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Make-Up Exam Policy</b>.  There will be no special or make-up
            examinations for any student (except in the case of emergency or the
            stated special accommodations determined at the disgression of the instructor
            <!-- <a href="#special-accommodations">special
            accommodations</a> -->).
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Redo Policy</b>.  This course is project-based, which
            means the learning is driven primarily by the lab assignments.  To
            encourage iteration until mastery, you may "redo" any assignment
            via an oral interview with the instructor for a maximum of 90%.
            A "redo" must be completed within <b>one week</b> of when the
            assignment is returned. You may request one interview per assignment.
            However, you may discuss your solutions with the instructors in office hours
            as much as you like before requesting your regrade. You must
            submit your lab on time to participate in a "redo".
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Extra Credit and Participation</b>.  Extra credit opportunities
            may be offered during the course semester.  Extra credit is recorded
            separately from normal grades and are only considered after final
            grades have been calculated.  If your final grade is just below a
            grade cutoff, extra credit may bump you up to the next grade.
            
            Finding a bug in the course materials
            that is then adopted is a standing offer for extra credit.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Teams and Pair Programming</b>.
              Your goal as a team is to help each other successfully complete the
              course project and the course together.
            
              You are asked to work on lab assignments in <b>pairs</b> from your team,
              enabling pair programming. You are also asked to work with a different
              partner for each lab assignment, enabling the benefit from the experience
              of your team.
                
              Lab assignments are the main
              opportunity to learn material in this course and thus they
              count for a relatively small portion of your final grade.
              It is strongly advised that you work on all the problems
              in a lab assignment together so that you understand
              all of the material and are prepared for the exam.  Everyone
              will submit assignments, and you must cite your partner
              explicitly.
              
              You are responsible for all assignments individually (e.g., if
              your partner drops the course midway though an assignment, you
              still need to submit on time).
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Interview Grading</b>.
            We will use interview grading for a portion of your lab assignment. Interviews
            will be conducted with your partner. Please be on-time to your interview slot.
            Given the large number of students, we cannot offer make up interviews if
            you miss it nor extra time if you are late.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Workload</b>.  CSCI 3155 is a 4-credit course.  This translates to

          We will consider the following criteria in our grading:
          <ul>
            <li><em>How well does your submission answer the questions</em>?  For
              example, a common mistake is to give an example when a question
              asks for an explanation.  An example may be useful in your
              explanation, but it should not take the place of the explanation.
              </li>

            <li><em>How clear is your submission</em>?  If we cannot understand
              what you are trying to say, then we cannot give you points for it.
              Try reading your answer aloud to yourself or a friend; this
              technique is often a great way to identify holes in your
              reasoning.  For code, not every program that "works" deserves full
              credit. We must be able to read and understand your intent.  Make
              sure you state any preconditions or invariants for your functions
              (either in comments, as assertions, or as <tt>require</tt> clauses
              as appropriate).</li>

            Mitchell Wand.  We will take liberty to deviate this text where
            appropriate, as we will use a different implementation language
            (Scala instead of Scheme).
            This book is available as an <a
            href="http://www.books24x7.com/marc.asp?bookid=26539">e-book</a> to

            <p>All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Additional information regarding the Honor Code policy can be found online and at the Honor Code Office.</p>

          We will also go by the policies set forth by the University:
          <blockquote>
          Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code.</blockquote>

CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy.
