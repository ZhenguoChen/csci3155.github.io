<p>Lazy kids.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to hard work?</p>
<p>A sure sign of my descent into senility is bitchin' and moanin'
about "kids these days," and how they won't or can't do anything hard
any more.</p>



<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">“You
were lucky. We lived for three months in a brown paper bag in a septic
tank. We had to get up at six in the morning, clean the bag, eat a
crust of stale bread, go to work down the mill, fourteen hours a day,
week-in week-out, and when we got home our Dad would thrash us to sleep
with his belt.” — Monty Python's Flying Circus,&nbsp;<em>Four Yorkshiremen</em></div>
<p>When <em>I</em> was a kid, I learned to program on punched cards. If
you made a mistake, you didn't have any of these modern features like a
backspace key to correct it. You threw away the card and started over.</p>
<p>When I started interviewing programmers in 1991, I would generally
let them use any language they wanted to solve the coding problems I
gave them. 99% of the time, they chose C.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they tend to choose Java.</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong: there's nothing wrong with Java as an implementation language.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, I want to modify that statement. I'm not claiming, <em>in this particular article,</em>
that there's anything wrong with Java as an implementation language.
There are lots of things wrong with it but those will have to wait for
a different article.</p>
<p>Instead what I'd like to claim is that Java is not, generally, a
hard enough programming language that it can be used to discriminate
between great programmers and mediocre programmers. It may be a fine
language to work in, but that's not today's topic. I would even go so
far as to say that the fact that Java is not hard enough is a feature,
not a bug, but it does have this one problem.</p>
<p>If I may be so brash, it has been my humble experience that there
are two things traditionally taught in universities as a part of a
computer science curriculum which many people just never really fully
comprehend: pointers and recursion.</p>
<p>You used to start out in college with a course in data structures,
with linked lists and hash tables and whatnot, with extensive use of
pointers. Those courses were often used as weedout courses: they were
so hard that anyone that couldn't handle the mental challenge of a CS
degree would give up, which was a good thing, because if you thought
pointers are hard, wait until you try to prove things about fixed point
theory.</p>
<p>All the kids who did great in high school writing pong games in
BASIC for their Apple II would get to college, take CompSci 101, a data
structures course, and when they hit the pointers business their brains
would just totally explode, and the next thing you knew, they were
majoring in Political Science because law school seemed like a better
idea. I've seen all kinds of figures for drop-out rates in CS and
they're usually between 40% and 70%. The universities tend to see this
as a waste; I think it's just a necessary culling of the people who
aren't going to be happy or successful in programming careers.</p>
<p>The other hard course for many young CS students was the course
where you learned functional programming, including recursive
programming. MIT set the bar very high for these courses, creating a
required <a href="http://sicp.csail.mit.edu/Fall-2005/">course</a> (6.001) and a textbook (Abelson &amp; Sussman's <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>)
which were used at dozens or even hundreds of top CS schools as the de
facto introduction to computer science. (You can, and should, watch an
older version of the lectures <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/">online</a>.)</p>
<p>The difficulty of these courses is astonishing. In the first lecture
you've learned pretty much all of Scheme, and you're already being
introduced to a fixed-point function that takes another function as its
input. When I struggled through such a course, CSE121 at Penn, I
watched as many if not most of the students just didn't make it. The
material was too hard. I wrote a long sob email to the professor saying
It Just Wasn't Fair. Somebody at Penn must have listened to me (or one
of the other complainers), because that course is now taught in Java.</p>
<p>I wish they hadn't listened.</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; width: 200px; float: right;">Think you have what it takes? <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TestYourself.html">Test Yourself Here!</a></div>
<p>Therein lies the debate. Years of whinging by lazy CS undergrads
like me, combined with complaints from industry about how few CS majors
are graduating from American universities, have taken a toll, and in
the last decade a large number of otherwise perfectly good schools have
gone 100% Java. It's hip, the recruiters who use "grep" to evaluate
resumes seem to like it, and, best of all, there's nothing hard enough
about Java to really weed out the programmers without the part of the
brain that does pointers or recursion, so the drop-out rates are lower,
and the computer science departments have more students, and bigger
budgets, and all is well.</p>
<p>The lucky kids of JavaSchools are never going to get weird segfaults
trying to implement pointer-based hash tables. They're never going to
go stark, raving mad trying to pack things into bits. They'll never
have to get their head around how, in a purely functional program, the
value of a variable never changes, and yet, it changes all the time! A
paradox!</p>
<p>They don't need that part of the brain to get a 4.0 in major.</p>
<p>Am I just one of those old-fashioned curmudgeons, like the Four
Yorkshiremen, bragging about how tough I was to survive all that hard
stuff?</p>
<p>Heck, in 1900, Latin and Greek were required subjects in college,
not because they served any purpose, but because they were sort of
considered an obvious requirement for educated people. In some sense my
argument is no different that the argument made by the pro-Latin people
(all four of them). "[Latin] trains your mind. Trains your memory.
Unraveling a Latin sentence is an excellent exercise in thought, a real
intellectual puzzle, and a good introduction to logical thinking," <a href="http://www.promotelatin.org/whylatin.htm">writes</a>
Scott Barker. But I can't find a single university that requires Latin
any more. Are pointers and recursion the Latin and Greek of Computer
Science?</p>
<p>Now, I freely admit that programming with pointers is not needed in
90% of the code written today, and in fact, it's downright dangerous in
production code. OK. That's fine. And functional programming is just
not used much in practice. Agreed.</p>
<p>But it's still important for some of the most exciting programming
jobs. Without pointers, for example, you'd never be able to work on the
Linux kernel. You can't understand a line of code in Linux, or, indeed,
any operating system, without really understanding pointers.</p>
<p>Without understanding functional programming, you can't invent <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce</a>,
the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable. The terms Map
and Reduce come from Lisp and functional programming. MapReduce is, in
retrospect, obvious to anyone who remembers from their 6.001-equivalent
programming class that purely functional programs have no side effects
and are thus trivially parallelizable. The very fact that Google
invented MapReduce, and Microsoft didn't, says something about why
Microsoft is still playing catch up trying to get basic search features
to work, while Google has moved on to the next problem: building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet">Skynet</a>^H^H^H^H^H^H the world's largest massively parallel <a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20051117.html">supercomputer</a>. I don't think Microsoft completely understands just how far behind they are on that wave.</p>
<p>But beyond the prima-facie importance of pointers and recursion,
their real value is that building big systems requires the kind of
mental flexibility you get from learning about them, and the mental
aptitude you need to avoid being weeded out of the courses in which
they are taught. Pointers and recursion require a certain ability to
reason, to think in abstractions, and, most importantly, to view a
problem at several levels of abstraction simultaneously. And thus, the
ability to understand pointers and recursion is directly correlated
with the ability to be a great programmer.</p>
<p>Nothing about an all-Java CS degree really weeds out the students
who lack the mental agility to deal with these concepts. As an
employer, I've seen that the 100% Java schools have started churning
out quite a few CS graduates who are simply not smart enough to work as
programmers on anything more sophisticated than Yet Another Java
Accounting Application, although they did manage to squeak through the
newly-dumbed-down coursework. These students would never survive 6.001
at MIT, or CS 323 at Yale, and frankly, that is one reason why, as an
employer, a CS degree from MIT or Yale carries more weight than a CS
degree from Duke, which recently went All-Java, or U. Penn, which
replaced Scheme and ML with Java in trying to teach the class that
nearly killed me and my friends, CSE121. Not that I don't want to hire
smart kids from Duke and Penn -- I do -- it's just a lot harder for me
to figure out who they are. I used to be able to tell the smart kids
because they could rip through a recursive algorithm in seconds, or
implement linked-list manipulation functions using pointers as fast as
they could write on the whiteboard. But with a JavaSchool Grad, I can't
tell if they're struggling with these problems because they are
undereducated or if they're struggling with these problems because they
don't actually have that special part of the brain that they're going
to need to do great programming work. Paul Graham calls them <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub Programmers</a>.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that JavaSchools fail to weed out the kids who are
never going to be great programmers, which the schools could
justifiably say is not their problem. Industry, or, at least, the
recruiters-who-use-grep, are surely clamoring for Java to be taught.</p>
<p>But JavaSchools also fail to train the brains of kids to be adept,
agile, and flexible enough to do good software design (and I don't mean
OO "design", where you spend countless hours rewriting your code to
rejiggle your object hierarchy, or you fret about faux "problems" like
has-a vs. is-a). You need training to think of things at multiple
levels of abstraction simultaneously, and that kind of thinking is
exactly what you need to design great software architecture.</p>
<p>You may be wondering if teaching object oriented programming (OOP)
is a good weed-out substitute for pointers and recursion. The quick
answer: no. Without debating OOP on the merits, it is just not hard
enough to weed out mediocre programmers. OOP in school consists mostly
of memorizing a bunch of vocabulary terms like "encapsulation" and
"inheritance" and taking multiple-choice <span title="If a quizzicle is a miniature quiz, what's the word for a miniature test?">quizzicles</span>
on the difference between polymorphism and overloading. Not much harder
than memorizing famous dates and names in a history class, OOP poses
inadequate mental challenges to scare away first-year students. When
you struggle with an OOP problem, <em>your program still works</em>, it's just sort of hard to maintain. Allegedly. But when you struggle with pointers, your program produces the line <strong>Segmentation Fault</strong>
and you have no idea what's going on, until you stop and take a deep
breath and really try to force your mind to work at two different
levels of abstraction simultaneously.</p>
<p>The recruiters-who-use-grep, by the way, are ridiculed here, and for
good reason. I have never met anyone who can do Scheme, Haskell, and C
pointers who can't pick up Java in two days, and create better Java
code than people with five years of experience in Java, but try
explaining that to the average HR drone.</p>
<p>But what about the CS mission of CS departments? They're not
vocational schools! It shouldn't be their job to train people to work
in industry. That's for community colleges and government retraining
programs for displaced workers, they will tell you. They're supposed to
be giving students the fundamental tools to live their lives, not
preparing them for their first weeks on the job. Right?</p><p><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/026.html"><img style="margin-left: 5px;" alt="Card Punch -- yes, I learned Fortran on one of these when I was 12." src="ThePerilsofJavaSchools_files/cs1.PNG" align="right" border="0"></a>Still.
CS is proofs (recursion), algorithms (recursion), languages (lambda
calculus), operating systems (pointers), compilers (lambda calculus) --
and so the bottom line is that a JavaSchool that won't teach C and
won't teach Scheme is not really teaching computer science, either. As
useless as the concept of function currying may be to the real world,
it's obviously a prereq for CS grad school. I can't understand why the
professors on the curriculum committees at CS schools have allowed
their programs to be dumbed down to the point where not only can't they
produce <em>working programmers</em>, they can't even produce CS grad
students who might get PhDs and compete for their jobs. Oh wait. Never
mind. Maybe I do understand. </p>
<p>Actually if you go back and research the discussion that took place
in academia during the Great Java Shift, you'll notice that the biggest
concern was whether Java was <em>simple </em>enough to use as a teaching language. </p>
<p><em>My God,</em> I thought, <em>they're</em><em>&nbsp;trying to dumb down the curriculum even further!</em>
Why not spoon feed everything to the students? Let's have the TAs take
their tests for them, too, then nobody will switch to American Studies.
How is anyone supposed to learn anything if the curriculum has been
carefully designed to make everything easier than it already is? There
seems to be a task force underway (<a href="http://www.sigcse.org/topics/javataskforce/java-task-force.pdf">PDF</a>)
to figure out a simple subset of Java that can be taught to students,
producing simplified documentation that carefully hides all that
EJB/J2EE crap from their tender minds, so they don't have to worry
their little heads with any classes that you don't need to do the
ever-easier CS problem sets.</p>
<p>The most sympathetic interpretation of why CS departments are so
enthusiastic to dumb down their classes is that it leaves them more
time to teach actual CS concepts, if they don't need to spend two whole
lectures unconfusing students about the difference between, say, a Java<strong>&nbsp;int </strong>and an <strong>Integer</strong>.
Well, if that's the case, 6.001 has the perfect answer for you: Scheme,
a teaching language so simple that the entire language can be taught to
bright students in about ten minutes; then you can spend the rest of
the semester on fixed points. </p>
<p>Feh. </p>
<p>I'm going back to ones and zeros.</p>
<p>(You had ones? Lucky bastard! All we got were zeros.)</p>
