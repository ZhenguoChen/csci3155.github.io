<h1>Course Overview and Goals</h1>

<p>
This course is about principles, concepts, and ideas that underly
programming languages.  But what does this statement mean?
</p>

<p>
As a student of computer science, it is completely reasonable to think
and ask, ``Why bother?  I'm proficient and like programming in Ruby.
Isn't that enough?  Isn't language choice just a matter of taste?  If
not, should I be using another language?''
</p>

<p>
Certainly, there are social factors and an aspect of personal
preference that affect the programming languages that we use.  But
there is also a body of principles and mathematical theories that
allow us to discuss and think about languages in a rigorous manner.
We study these underpinnings because a language affects the way one
approaches problems working in that language and affects the way one
implements that language.  At the end of this course, we hope that you
will have grown in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>
  You will be able to learn new languages quickly and select a
  suitable one for your task.
  </li>
  <li>
  You will gain new ways of viewing computation and
  approaching algorithmic problems.
  </li>
  <li>
  You will gain new ways of viewing programs.
  </li>
  <li>
  You will gain insight into avoiding mistakes for when
  you design languages.
</ul>

<p>
We will <em>dissect</em> programming languages by constructing
interpreters.  The semester project is to construct an interpreter for
<a
 href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf">JavaScript</a>
(incrementally).  We will see that interpreters are the basis for
realizing computation, and we will study the programming language
theory that enable us to reason carefully about a language's design
and implementation.  Our approach will be gradual in that we will
initially consider a small subset of JavaScript and then slowly grow
the aspects of the language that we consider.
</p>

<p>Incoming students often expect this course to be what I will call a
trip to the Zoo of Programming Languages.  While it is certainly
interesting to go to the zoo, we seek a more informative and
sciencific study of the underlying principles.  A more apt analogy is
an <b>anatomy</b> course where we will study the "guts" and
inner-workings of programming languages.  After this course, such an
anatomological study will enable us to compare and constrast
programming languages in a substantive manner and address the learning
goals outlined above.</p>

<p>
The course covers many aspects of using, understanding, and
reasoning about programming languages (e.g., syntax, scoping,
induction, data types, and typing).  We will build up a set
of mathematical tools for careful discourse.
A significant part is devoted to abstraction, that is, how
languages help programming in the large (e.g.,
subtyping polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, modules, and objects).
</p>


<p>
This course prepares you for introductory courses on both programming
language implementation
(e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci4555.html">CSCI
4555</a>) and programming language semantics
(e.g., <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/courses/csci5535.html">CSCI
5535</a>).
</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>
The prerequisites for this course are CSCI 2270 (Computer Science 2: Data Structures)
and CSCI 2824 (Discrete Mathematics).  It is also suggested that one
of CSCI 2400 (Computer Systems) or ECEN
2120 (Computers as Components) be either previously taken or
be taken in the same semester.
</p>

<p>If you have not already taken these courses or if you have any concerns,
please talk with the instructor. Proficiency in programming is absolutely
expected, though there is no specific language required. This means that you
should be able to pick up a new programming language with relative ease. You
will be expected to learn new programming languages with guidance but
relatively independently in this course.  </p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>
You will be responsible for the following:
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="assignments.html#labs">Lab
  Assignments</a></b> (30%).  This course is a project-based course,
  so most of the understanding will come from attacking the lab
  assignments. Lab assignments will be two
  weeks in length.  Because iteration on lab assignments is
  the basis for learning in this course, we offer a generous "redo"
  policy on lab assignments (see below).  No late assignments will be accepted, but your lowest lab grade will be dropped.
  <li><b>Exercises</b> (10%).  There will be in-class exercises
  associated with each unit. There will be no make-ups if you miss an in-class exercise, but your lowest exercise grade will be dropped.
  <li><b>Midterm Exam</b> (25%). There will be one midterm exam.
  <li><b>Final Exam</b> (30%).
  <li><b><a href="assignments.html#participation">Class
  Participation</a></b> (5%).  Participation includes both in-class and
  online discussion.
  <li><b>Reading</b>.  There will be required articles or book
  chapters to read.  This course will emphasize learning from
  the resources out of class and actively discussing problems
  and questions in class.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  <b>Grading</b>.
  Your overall grade will be determined using the ratio for lab
  assignments, exercises, the midterm exam, the final
  exam, and class participation shown above.  There is no
  predetermined curve (i.e., I hope everyone gets an A based on the
  level of mastery demonstrated). Cutoffs will be announced after 
  the midterm exam to give you an idea where you stand.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Regrades</b>. Any concern about an error in grading must
  be submitted within <b>one week</b> of when it is
  returned. Any coursework submitted for reconsideration may be
  regraded in its entirety, which could result in a lower score if
  warranted.  To request a regrade, please go to the instructor's
  office hours with your coursework and an explanation of what you
  believe the grading error to be.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Make-Up Exam Policy</b>.  There will be no special or make-up
  examinations for any student (except in the case of emergency or the
  stated <a href="#special-accommodations">special
  accommodations</a>).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Redo Policy</b>.  This course is project-based, which
  means the learning is driven primarily by the lab assignments.  To
  encourage iteration until mastery, you may "redo" any assignment
  via an oral interview with the instructor for a maximum of 90%.
  A "redo" must be completed within <b>one week</b> of when the
  assignment is returned. You may request one interview per assignment.
  However, you may discuss your solutions with the instructors in office hours
  as much as you like before requesting your regrade. You must
  submit your lab on time to participate in a "redo".
</p>

<p>
  <b>Extra Credit and Participation</b>.  Extra credit opportunities
  may be offered during the course semester.  Extra credit is recorded
  separately from normal grades and are only considered after final
  grades have been calculated.  If your final grade is just below a
  grade cutoff, extra credit may bump you up to the next grade.
  
  Finding a bug in the course materials
  that is then adopted is a standing offer for extra credit.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Teams and Pair Programming</b>.
    Your goal as a team is to help each other successfully complete the
    course project and the course together.
  
    You are asked to work on lab assignments in <b>pairs</b> from your team,
    enabling pair programming. You are also asked to work with a different
    partner for each lab assignment, enabling the benefit from the experience
    of your team.
      
    Lab assignments are the main
    opportunity to learn material in this course and thus they
    count for a relatively small portion of your final grade.
    It is strongly advised that you work on all the problems
    in a lab assignment together so that you understand
    all of the material and are prepared for the exam.  Everyone
    will submit assignments, and you must cite your partner
    explicitly.
    
    You are responsible for all assignments individually (e.g., if
    your partner drops the course midway though an assignment, you
    still need to submit on time).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Interview Grading</b>.
  We will use interview grading for a portion of your lab assignment. Interviews
  will be conducted with your partner. Please be on-time to your interview slot.
  Given the large number of students, we cannot offer make up interviews if
  you miss it nor extra time if you are late.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Workload</b>.  CSCI 3155 is a 4-credit course.  This translates to
  the standard expectation of approximately 8 hours of outside of class
  time per week or 16 hours per two-week lab.
</p>

<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<p>
Both your ideas and also the clarity with which they are expressed
matter&mdash;both in your English prose and your code!
</p>

<p>
We will consider the following criteria in our grading:
<ul>
  <li><em>How well does your submission answer the questions</em>?  For
    example, a common mistake is to give an example when a question
    asks for an explanation.  An example may be useful in your
    explanation, but it should not take the place of the explanation.

  <li><em>How clear is your submission</em>?  If we cannot understand
    what you are trying to say, then we cannot give you points for it.
    Try reading your answer aloud to yourself or a friend; this
    technique is often a great way to identify holes in your
    reasoning.  For code, not every program that "works" deserves full
    credit. We must be able to read and understand your intent.  Make
    sure you state any preconditions or invariants for your functions
    (either in comments, as assertions, or as <tt>require</tt> clauses
    as appropriate).

</ul>
</p>

<h1 id="resources">Textbook and Resources</h1>

<p>
  <b>Textbook</b>. The primary reading for the course is the course notes
  (<a href="csci3155-notes.pdf">Principles 
  and Practice in Programming Languages</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The course follows many ideas from a supplemental text:
  <a
  href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/essentials-of-programming-languages/oclc/263455693">Essentials
  of Programming Languages, 3rd edition</a> by Daniel P. Friedman and
  Mitchell Wand.  We will take liberty to deviate this text where
  appropriate, as we will use a different implementation language
  (Scala instead of Scheme).
  This book is available as an <a
  href="http://www.books24x7.com/marc.asp?bookid=26539">e-book</a> to
  all University students.
</p>
<p>
  We also strongly recommend that you get access to <a
  href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/programming-in-scala/oclc/731510960">Programming
  in Scala, 2nd edition</a> by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners.
  This book is an extended tutorial for
  learning Scala by those directly involved in the language's
  development.
</p>
<p>
  Two other useful Scala texts:
  <a href="http://www.atomicscala.com/">Atomic Scala</a>
  by Bruce Eckel and Dianne Marsh;
  <a href="http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/">Functional Programming in Scala</a>
  by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason.
</p>
<p>
  <b>JavaScript</b>.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.  A JavaScript
    platform for server applications based on Google Chrome's V8
    JavaScript engine.  We recommend installing node.js to try
    out small JavaScript examples on the command-line.  Node.js
    0.10.24 will serve as our reference JavaScript implementation.

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>
  <b>Moodle</b>.  We will use Moodle for grades and feedback.
  If you do not already have an account, please create one and join
  the course moodle.  The enrollment key is in the welcome e-mail.
</p>

<p><b>Piazza</b>. We will be using Piazza for online, outside-of-class
  discussion.  Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff,
  questions should be posted on Piazza.  I encourage you to make
  class-wide posts whenever possible, but there is an option to send
  an instructor-private message.  You also have the option of posting
  anonymously.</p>

<p id=computing-resources>
  <b>Computing</b>. We strongly suggest you use the standardized
  development environment on the <a href="https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/">CU CS Virtual Machine</a>.
  After obtaining the Virtual Machine, you will need to install the following separately:
  <ul>
    <li>The CSCI 3155 package via
    <blockquote>
    <code>
      $ sudo apt-get update<br>
      $ sudo apt-get install cu-cs-csci-3155
    </code>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>IntelliJ IDEA from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1 id="materials">Integrity of the Course Materials</h1>

<p>
  The development effort in the course materials,
  including the lab assignments, the exercises, and the exams,
  is significant.
  You agree that you will not share any course materials publicly
  or privately outside of your teams.
  The course materials, include your or anyone else's solutions to the lab
  assignments, exercises, and exams.
  In particular, you agree not to post your solutions to the lab assignments
  in a public source code repository, such as public Github repositories. Please use private
  source code repositories for your work.
</p>

<p>
  Note that there is no conflict with the <a href="#collaboration#">Collaboration Policy</a> described below.
  You are welcome and encouraged to support each other in the learning of the material.
</p>

<h1 id="collaboration">Collaboration Policy</h1>

<p>
You are welcome and encouraged to work together in learning the
material.  If you worked with someone on an assignment, or if your
submission includes quotes from a book, a paper, or a web site, you
should thank the source.  Bottom line, feel free to use resources that
are available to you as long as the use is <b>reasonable</b> and
you <b>cite</b> them in your submission.  However, <b>copying
answers directly or indirectly from solution manuals, web pages, or
your peers is certainly unreasonable</b>.  If you have any doubts in this
regard, please ask the course staff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Academic Dishonesty Policy</b>. 
We will go by the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/honorcode/">Honor
Code</a> set forth by the University:
<blockquote>
  <p>All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). Additional information regarding the Honor Code policy can be found online and at the Honor Code Office.</p>
</blockquote>
Academic sanctions may include, but is not limited to, a zero for the assignment or a failing grade for the course.
</p>

<h1>Classroom Behavior</h1>

<p>
We trust and expect everyone to behave in a civil and courteous
manner.  
</p>

<p>
In class, the course staff promises their undivided attention and
reciprocally expects the same from you.  In today's world, this
promise requires <b>turning off transmitting devices</b>, such as cell
phones and wi-fi on notebook computers.  Notebook computers should be
used only for purposes directly relevant to the class discussion
(e.g., taking notes).  Please notify the course staff if you encounter
behavior that distracts from your learning.
</p>

<p>
We will also go by the policies set forth by the University:
<blockquote>
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code.</blockquote>
</p>

<h1>Discrimination and Harassment</h1>

<p>
We will go by the policies set forth by the University:
<blockquote>
  <p>
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be found at the OIEC website. The full policy on discrimination and harassment contains additional information.
  </p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h1>Disability</h1>

<p>
We will go by
the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices">disability
guidelines</a> set forth by the University:
<blockquote>
<p>
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please
submit to the course staff a letter from
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices">
Disability Services</a> within the <b>first four weeks</b> of class so
that your needs can be reasonably addressed.  Disability Services
determines accommodations based on documented disabilities.
</p>
<p>
If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your professor.
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h1>Religious Observances</h1>

We will go by the
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html">
policy for religious observances</a> set forth by the University:
<blockquote>
<p>
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty
make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who,
because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,
assignments or required attendance.  In this class, we will try to
accommodate religious conflicts in a reasonable manner.  Please check
the <a href="schedule.html">exam dates</a> and submit all requests for
adjustments within the <b>first four weeks</b> of class.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html">www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html</a> for further details on the policy.
</p>
