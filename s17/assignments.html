<h1 id="participation">Class Participation</h1>

<p>Classes focus on discussion, so it is certainly important to
participate in class and read the readings beforehand.</p>

<p>Students are expected to be active participants in the online forums (e.g., around at least 1 substantive post per week).  You may and are encouraged to post comments or questions about the reading before the class where we will cover it.  Posting early will help focus our discussion. </p>

<p>
Here are some examples of good comments:
<ul>
  <li>Questions about the reading or the class discussion.
  <li>Thoughtful answers to other people's questions.
  <li>Clarification of some point discussed in class.
  <li>Comments on a web resource related to a reading or class
    discussion (e.g., you happened upon an interesting blog post
    related to our discussion).
</ul>
</p>

<p> If everything from a class meeting seems clear to you, try to come up with a question that tests your classmates' understanding. Put yourself in the position of an instructor! </p>

<p> Overall, the intent is for you to to take a moment to reflect upon the day's reading or class discussion.  I will read all posts, but I may not respond to all of them (e.g., if I believe your classmates'
answers are sufficient). </p>
